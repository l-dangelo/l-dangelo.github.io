        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My audio experience is centered around games: implementing audio, creating
          assets, and recording. Additionally, I also am a classically trained
          pianist and violinist with familiarity composing for multiple instruments.

        <h3>Lead Sound Designer</h3>
        <!-- ADD VIDEO -->
        <p>
          Death Bloom is a short puzzle horror game created in Unreal Engine 5 by
          the University of Texas at Dallas' Spring 2023 Game Lab. This project
          was created by a team of 45+ people. I was the Lead Sound Designer and
          was in charge of 3 main sound design students &#40;part of the project
          for the entire semester&#41; plus 13 &#34;contract&#34; sound design
          students &#40;worked on the project for around half of the semester.&#41;
        </p>
        <p>
          My role for this project included establishing audio standards,
          determining what sounds needed to be present, approving or requesting
          changes for submitted sounds, ensuring that the sounds fit with what
          designers and artists had created, and implementing those sounds and
          requests into engine. This role required a lot of communication - not only
          between the sound team members, but also between deparatments - to set
          deadlines and expectations for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, this project involved mostly working in engine to implement sounds
          and communication with other deparatments. From this project, I gained a
          lot of experience using Unreal Engine 5's audio tools. This includes audio
          volumes, sound cues, and most fun, Metasounds. As I did most of the sound
          implementation, I also did a lot of work using Unreal's blueprint system.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My audio experience is centered around games: implementing audio, creating
          assets, and recording. Additionally, I also am a classically trained
          pianist and violinist with familiarity composing for multiple instruments.

        <h3>Lead Sound Designer</h3>
        <!-- ADD VIDEO (when trailer gets made) -->
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>
          Death Bloom is a short puzzle horror game created in Unreal Engine 5 by
          the University of Texas at Dallas' Spring 2023 Game Lab. This project
          was created by a team of 45+ people. I was the Lead Sound Designer and
          was in charge of 3 main sound design students &#40;part of the project
          for the entire semester&#41; plus 13 &#34;contract&#34; sound design
          students &#40;worked on the project for around half of the semester&#41;.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role for this project included establishing audio standards,
          determining what sounds needed to be present, approving or requesting
          changes for submitted sounds, ensuring that the sounds fit with what
          designers and artists had created, and implementing those sounds and
          requests into engine. This role required a lot of communication - not only
          between the sound team members, but also between deparatments - to set
          deadlines and expectations for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, this project involved mostly working in engine to implement sounds
          and communication with other deparatments. From this project, I gained a
          lot of experience using Unreal Engine 5's audio tools. This includes audio
          volumes, sound cues, and most fun, Metasounds. As I did most of the sound
          implementation, I also did a lot of work using Unreal's blueprint system.
        </p>

        <h4>Things I Made</h4>
        <p>
          In this project, I did most of the implementation. Here are some of 
          the MetaSounds I created. Due to the limitations of blueprintue, you 
          cannot acutally hear the sounds in the blueprint, so listen to the 
          videos below to hear the sounds themselves.

          <p>
            Creating this MetaSound was surprisingly challenging. When the player 
            first gets the lantern, there is no magical ambience. The magical 
            ambience is controlled by two inputs, isMagical and isLevel3. This 
            is because the magical ambience is two parts: the regular magic and 
            the "moon" magic which is important to the narrative of the game. 
            These inputs are changed in the lantern blueprint as well as the 
            level blueprint. However, before the lantern becomes magical, I 
            want the lantern noise loop to have some variation. I accomplished 
            this by having two wave players, one to play the regular loop and 
            the second to play a pitch shifted loop. I have two wave players 
            so that the change in frequency is not abrput, but interps between 
            the shifted loop and the regular loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            This MetaSound controls the ambience for level 2. Of the three levels 
            in the game, this one has the most variation in ambience. There are 
            5 parts to it: the room tone, low drone, medium drone, intense drone, 
            and the "spooky zone". I am able to balance these relative to each 
            other in the MetaSound as the game is playing. Additionally, I learned 
            a lot about generating sounds in engine when making the "spooky zone" 
            ambience. The ambience samples a very small part of an asset used 
            in a different part of the level to create a rhythmic, looping sound. 
            In this demo, the audio asset for the "Intense Drone" has not yet 
            been added. Unlike other assets in the game, this is also a stereo 
            asset as I wanted it to play non-diegetically.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Level 1, the player crafts something by pouring liquids. I wanted 
            the sound to increase in pitch as the player added more liquid to 
            the bucket to mimic real life. The player can pour at most two liquids 
            into the bucket. To mimic this, I created this MetaSound to flip 
            between the two assets I wanted to play. This was easier than doing 
            it in a blueprint or another method as I could easily tie the 
            MetaSound to the liquid pouring animation. Unfortunately, the video 
            doesn't showcase the MetaSound acutally working as Unreal cannot 
            simulate that, but it does work in the final build.

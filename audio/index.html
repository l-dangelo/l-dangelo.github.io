      <h1>Audio Projects</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My audio experience is centered around games: implementing audio, creating
        assets, and recording. Additionally, I also am a classically trained
        pianist and violinist with familiarity composing for solo and multiple instruments.

      <h3>Lead Sound Designer</h3>
      
      <h4>About the Project</h4>
      <p>
        Death Bloom is a short puzzle horror game created in Unreal Engine 5 by
        the University of Texas at Dallas' Spring 2023 Game Lab. This project
        was created by a team of 45+ people. I was the Lead Sound Designer and
        was in charge of 3 main sound design students &#40;part of the project
        for the entire semester&#41; plus 13 &#34;contract&#34; sound design
        students &#40;worked on the project for around half of the semester&#41;.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role for this project included establishing audio standards,
        determining what sounds needed to be present, approving or requesting
        changes for submitted sounds, ensuring that the sounds fit with what
        designers and artists had created, and implementing those sounds and
        requests into engine. This role required a lot of communication - not only
        between the sound team members, but also between deparatments - to set
        deadlines and expectations for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, this project involved mostly working in engine to implement sounds
        and communication with other deparatments. From this project, I gained a
        lot of experience using Unreal Engine 5's audio tools. This includes audio
        volumes, sound cues, and most fun, Metasounds. As I did most of the sound
        implementation, I also did a lot of work using Unreal's blueprint system.
      </p>

      <h4>Things I Made</h4>
      <p>
        In this project, I did most of the implementation and creation of the game's 
        MetaSounds. Here are some of the MetaSounds I created. Due to the 
        limitations of blueprintue, you cannot acutally hear the sounds in the 
        blueprint, so listen to the videos below to hear the sounds themselves.
      </p>

          <h4 class="msGrid">Lantern Noise</h4>
          <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/3oj3adky/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/vQS_fC5xFFA"></iframe>
          <p>
            Creating this MetaSound was surprisingly challenging. When the player 
            first gets the lantern, there is no magical ambience. The magical 
            ambience is controlled by two inputs, isMagical and isLevel3. This 
            is because the magical ambience is two parts: the regular magic and 
            the "moon" magic which is important to the narrative of the game. 
            These inputs are changed in the lantern blueprint as well as the 
            level blueprint. However, before the lantern becomes magical, I 
            want the lantern noise loop to have some variation. I accomplished 
            this by having two wave players, one to play the regular loop and 
            the second to play a pitch shifted loop. I have two wave players 
            so that the change in frequency is not abrput, but interps between 
            the shifted loop and the regular loop.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4 class="msGrid">Level 2 Drone</h4>
          <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/048-hbjr/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/KYKQV5BJPD0"></iframe>
          <p>
            This MetaSound controls the ambience for level 2. Of the three levels 
            in the game, this one has the most variation in ambience. There are 
            5 parts to it: the room tone, low drone, medium drone, intense drone, 
            and the "spooky zone". I am able to balance these relative to each 
            other in the MetaSound as the game is playing. Additionally, I learned 
            a lot about generating sounds in engine when making the "spooky zone" 
            ambience. The ambience samples a very small part of an asset used 
            in a different part of the level to create a rhythmic, looping sound. 
            In this demo, the audio asset for the "Intense Drone" has not yet 
            been added. Unlike other assets in the game, this is also a stereo 
            asset as I wanted it to play non-diegetically.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4 class="msGrid">Liquid Pouring</h4>
          <iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/s5x25i5q/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/hiMkwKindyQ"></iframe>
          <p>
            In Level 1, the player crafts something by pouring liquids. I wanted 
            the sound to increase in pitch as the player added more liquid to 
            the bucket to mimic real life. The player can pour at most two liquids 
            into the bucket. To mimic this, I created this MetaSound to flip 
            between the two assets I wanted to play. This was easier than doing 
            it in a blueprint or another method as I could easily tie the 
            MetaSound to the liquid pouring animation. Unfortunately, the video 
            doesn't showcase the MetaSound acutally working as Unreal cannot 
            simulate that, but it does work in the final build.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My skills in game design include: level design, scripting/programming, 
          concept/game design. I have used Unity Engine and Unreal Engine
          4/5 extensively. Additionally, I am familiar with GameMaker Studio.

        <h2>Capstone: XiaChron &#40;Ongoing&#41;</h2>
        <h3>Lead Programmer, Assistant Game Designer, Assistant Sound Designer</h3>
        <p>
          XiaChron was created during my final semester at UTD with 
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haven-gibbs/" target="_blank">Haven Gibbs</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raylie-sherman-8b1508204/" target="_blank">Hope Sherman</a>. 
          It is a 2d, UI-based game made in Unity. Players are attempting to classify
          animals on an exo-planet. For this project, my main role was to 
          program the game systems and setup the basic UI. Please see the linked 
          GitHub Repo for my work. This project is still ongoing, so please check 
          back at mid-May, when the project will be complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to programming, I also helped design the concepts of
          the game (from the flow to the specific tests and interactions
          the player could have), implemented audio, and solved any Git 
          problems.
        </p>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
          Though it seems contrary to initial thought, working in a small team 
          is easier than a large one. Even though we were only a team of three, 
          it felt like we were able to get a lot of work done and come to decisions 
          fairly quickly. Even when compared to being a lead in a larger project, 
          and therefore making decisions with a comparable amount of people, 
          things just tended to go by quicker in a small group (there were also 
          significantly less merge conflicts).
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of actual programming, I learned more about how the Unity UI 
          system works, state machines, and basic editor scripting; the latter 
          two being things I had never done before. This project has also taught 
          me a lot about designing code for larger, more long term projects. 
          Generally, we only use a project for one, small assignment, lasting a 
          couple weeks at most and being worked on by one person. This project 
          has been worked on and added to for a relatively long amount of time. 
          As XiaChron progressed, I had to refactor previously written code to 
          be more readable and functional. I knew from the beginning that this 
          project would require a lot more interconnectivity between scripts and 
          objects, but I didn't realize to what extent until I started working 
          on it. Thankfully, nothing caught on fire too badly, and it all works 
          (for now).

        <h2>Classic D&D Start</h2>
        <h3>Prototyped in Unreal 5.1</h3>
        <p>
          You sit down at the table, and your character wakes up in jail. It's 
          a classic start to countless D&D campaigns and many other RPGs. This 
          prototype is a recreation of the first half of a D&D 5e/Pathfinder 2e
          module I created for a starter session. 
          This is a simple and quick prototype I made to refamiliarize myself 
          with Unreal once Unreal 5 was released. The video below is a playthrough of 
          the level. As of now, there is no audio, but when making this, I felt 
          comfortable enough with my abilities to implement audio in Unreal. See 
          <a href="audio.html#DeathBloom">Death Bloom</a> to see more about me 
          implementing sounds in Unreal.
        </p>

          <h4>Behind the Design</h4>
          <image class="img" float="left" src="Images\dwarvenPrison1.png"></image>
          When designing the first half of this module, I had a few goals in 
          mind: 1. let the players quickly introduce themselves; 2. quickly give 
          the players minimal gear; and 3. provide some context in the world. 
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Let the players quickly introduce themselves. In this module, all 
          of the players get released from their cells at the same time and there 
          is no one else around. They are being forced by circumstance (me) to 
          work together.
          <br />
          2. Quickly give players minimal gear. The star icon on the map provides 
          basic weapons to the players (like those one might find in a fantasy 
          jail). This allows the players to not feel completely helpless as the 
          solve problems and eventually fight the creature haunting the tunnels.
          <br />
          3. Provide some context in the world. I have played TTRPGs (and games 
          in general) long enough to know that no player wants to listen or read 
          about a vastly complex world with every detail figured out. They don't 
          want to hear it; I don't have time to write it. This module aims to solve 
          this by providing easy context that any character could fit into: you're 
          in a (very) recently abandoned jail, something is hunting you. You 
          should probably escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recreating this in Unreal required a little tweaking. I am not a 
          3d-artist and the purpose of this prototype wasn't to source models, 
          so conveying information via environmental story telling would be hard. 
          I focused instead on making sure the mechanics worked properly, the 
          level was playable, and that there would be places and ways to implement 
          good storytelling later.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I did not want 
          to convey information to the player via text, I decided that the 
          main puzzle would be convey through lights. I wanted it to be obvious 
          to the player that the lights were connected with the chair, so I flashed 
          the wall and chair lights before displaying the order in which the chairs 
          had to be interacted with. Additionally, the player is free to retrigger 
          the light sequence as many times as they need; however, the sequence 
          will not start playing until it finishes.

        <h2>Climb On!</h2>
        <h3>One Week Prototype</h3>
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>
          This project was created in one week for my Game Design 2 class in 
          GameMaker Studio. We were given the prompt/mechanic "ladders" 
          and were told to make a sidescroller. In my prototype, the player moves 
          4 independent "limbs" &#40;two hands and two feet&#41;. The goal of the 
          game is to reach the top "hold" with both hands. My interpretation of the 
          prompt, rock climbing, uses the given mechanic to allow the player to 
          stop their movement at different verticalities. This is helpful to the 
          player as the lose condition is letting your "hips" &#40;the box in the 
          center of the screen&#41; touch the wall. The art theme for this project 
          was "monochrome", which is why there is only black and three shades of blue.
        </p>

        <h4>What I Would Change</h4>
        <p>
          The one level in this project is very difficult, which is by far the 
          largest piece of feedback I recieved. Additionally, I would also add more 
          feedback for the player &#40;highlight which limb they are currently using, 
          add audio feedback, and create an actual UI&#41;.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this class, we have an opportunity to take one of our prototypes and 
          expand upon it via adding more levels, changing the theme &#40;to a different 
          in-class theme&#41;, and spending more time on it. I will be taking the 
          feedback mentioned above and implementing it into my game. Furthermore, 
          I have refactored the code to run better in GameMaker Studio. I have changed
          the theme from monochrome to friendly robots, meaning that inspiration 
          will be more obvious and an actual story.

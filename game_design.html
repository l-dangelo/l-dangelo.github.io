        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My skills in game design include: level design, scripting/programming, 
          concept/game design. I have used Unity Engine and Unreal Engine
          4/5 extensively. Additionally, I am familiar with GameMaker Studio.

        <h2>Capstone: XiaChron &#40;Ongoing&#41;</h2>
        <h3>Lead Programmer, Assistant Game Designer, Assistant Sound Designer</h3>
        <p>
          XiaChron was created during my final semester at UTD. It is a 2d,
          UI-based game made in Unity. Players are attempting to classify
          animals on an exo-planet. For this project, my main role was to 
          program the game systems. Please see the linked GitHub Repo for my work.
          This project is still ongoing, so also check the specific website for
          updates and news.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to programming, I also helped design the concepts of
          the game - from the flow to the specific tests and interactions
          the player could have - and implemented audio.

        <h3>One Week Prototype</h3>
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>
          This project was created in one week for my Game Design 2 class in 
          GameMaker Studio. We were given the prompt/mechanic "ladders" 
          and were told to make a sidescroller. In my prototype, the player moves 
          4 independent "limbs" &#40;two hands and two feet&#41;. The goal of the 
          game is to reach the top "hold" with both hands. My interpretation of the 
          prompt, rock climbing, uses the given mechanic to allow the player to 
          stop their movement at different verticalities. This is helpful to the 
          player as the lose condition is letting your "hips" &#40;the box in the 
          center of the screen&#41; touch the wall. The art theme for this project 
          was "monochrome", which is why there is only black and three shades of blue.
        </p>

        <h4>What I Would Change</h4>
        <p>
          The one level in this project is very difficult, which is by far the 
          largest piece of feedback I recieved. Additionally, I would also add more 
          feedback for the player &#40;highlight which limb they are currently using, 
          add audio feedback, and create an actual UI&#41;.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this class, we have an opportunity to take one of our prototypes and 
          expand upon it via adding more levels, changing the theme &#40;to a different 
          in-class theme&#41;, and spending more time on it. I will be taking the 
          feedback mentioned above and implementing it into my game. Furthermore, 
          I have refactored the code to run better in GameMaker Studio. I have changed
          the theme from monochrome to friendly robots, meaning that inspiration 
          will be more obvious and an actual story.
